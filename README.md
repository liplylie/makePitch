# Pitch Detector 

### Description
opens client's microphone and can determine music pitch. I do not take credit for this code. Code is taken from microsoft's website: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/testdrive/demos/webaudiotuner/. I simply refactored the code a bit so that the microphone is always open, and the pitch can be seen in the console by opening the debugging tool.
